Tina's personal site
Original site was made May 2021 following a Udemy Bootcamp. It had small clouds at the top, a mountain (that I hated) and the format seemed very boring to me. I have finally found tiem and feel comfortable in my skills to re-vamp my page in January 2022. Plus I added new areas like portfolio to showcase some of my previous projects.
